# Aircraft Flight Control System
This repository contains Capella models for a conceptual Aircraft Flight Control System. i.e. these models do not correspond to any such existing system and are done to exemplify the capabilities of Capella in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).

These models are part of our Capstone project in the Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering department of McGill University - an effort supervised by Professor Daniel Varro and Mr. Aren Babikian.
